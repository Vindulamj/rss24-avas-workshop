The noteworthy progress in autonomous vehicle technologies is indisputable, as evidenced by the increasing momentum in real-world deployments on an industrial scale. While much research focus has traditionally been on the ego-vehicle development, such as advancing perception and planning algorithms, the research landscape is emergently undergoing a transformation to look beyond the ego-vehicle to a more broader use and implications of autonomous vehicles. These emerging scales of autonomous vehicle research revolve around the challenges, impact, and applications of AVs, spanning traffic level (e.g., utilizing autonomous vehicles as Lagrangian actuators for optimizing traffic flow), network level (e.g., integrating autonomous vehicles as robo-taxis in dynamic mobility-on-demand systems), and even the regional level (e.g., shaping autonomous vehicles related policymaking).

Our goal is to bring together a diverse group of researchers from robotics, intelligent transportation related sub fields who are operating at different scales of autonomous vehicle research. We strive to create a unified platform for the exchange of ideas and the cultivation of interactions among these researches. By promoting collaboration across various autonomous vehicle research scales, we envision uncovering previously unnoticed challenges and foster co-design of effective solutions that will move the autonomous vehicle research field as a whole.



#### Discussion Topics

- **Ego-vehicle level**: Potential sub topics include planning, perception and behavior prediction.
- **Traffic level**: Potential sub topics include use of AVs for social benefits (ex: traffic smoothing and eco-driving).
- **Network level**: Potential sub topics include solving combinatorial optimization problems involving autonomous vehicles at the network level. 
- **Scale overlaps**: Potential sub topics include co-design techniques that involve two or more scales of autonomos vehicle research.
- **Benchmarks**: What benchmark environments will help the community better measure the progress of autonomous vehicles research at different scales.

### Schedule

The workshop will be held in-person on July 14 in in Delft, Netherlands. 

A link to live stream of the workshop will be provided closer to the date. The recording will be made available through Youtube after the workshop.
