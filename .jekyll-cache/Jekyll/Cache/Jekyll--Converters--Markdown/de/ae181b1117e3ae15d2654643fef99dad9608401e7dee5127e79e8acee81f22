<p>The noteworthy progress in autonomous vehicle technologies is indisputable, as evidenced by the increasing momentum in real-world deployments on an industrial scale. While much research focus has traditionally been on the ego-vehicle development, such as advancing perception and planning algorithms, the research landscape is emergently undergoing a transformation to look beyond the ego-vehicle to a more broader use and implications of autonomous vehicles. These emerging scales of autonomous vehicle research revolve around the challenges, impact, and applications of AVs, spanning traffic level (e.g., utilizing autonomous vehicles as Lagrangian actuators for optimizing traffic flow), network level (e.g., integrating autonomous vehicles as robo-taxis in dynamic mobility-on-demand systems), and even the regional level (e.g., shaping autonomous vehicles related policymaking).</p>

<p>Our goal is to bring together a diverse group of researchers from robotics, intelligent transportation related sub fields who are operating at different scales of autonomous vehicle research. We strive to create a unified platform for the exchange of ideas and the cultivation of interactions among these researches. By promoting collaboration across various autonomous vehicle research scales, we envision uncovering previously unnoticed challenges and foster co-design of effective solutions that will move the autonomous vehicle research field as a whole.</p>

<h4 id="discussion-topics">Discussion Topics</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Benchmarks</strong>: What benchmark environments will help the community better measure the progress of TAMP and integrate learning with TAMP?</li>
  <li><strong>Large Language Models for Task Planning</strong>: LLM has shown promise in generalizable task planning. What are the potentials and challenges in integrating LLM with TAMP?</li>
  <li><strong>Perception</strong>: Perception in TAMP and the latest developments in this area, including 3D computer vision, open-world recognition, and sensor fusion.</li>
  <li><strong>Error Recovery / Closed-Loop TAMP</strong>: Techniques and principles that allow TAMP to be more robust and recover from errors and interventions.</li>
  <li><strong>Skill Learning / Manipulation</strong>: Skill learning and manipulation for TAMP, including but not limited to deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning. How do we make the learned skills generalizable and composable?</li>
  <li><strong>Model Learning</strong>: Techniques and principles for learning discrete or continuous transition models from interaction data.</li>
</ul>
